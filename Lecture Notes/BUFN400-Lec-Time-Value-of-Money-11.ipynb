    "Lectures on the time value of money typically begin with the idea that one dollar today is worth more than one dollar in the future.  While true for most times in the last 100 years, this statement is not always true.  In recent decades, Japan, Switzerland, the United States, and the Euro-zone have experience negative interest rates, allowing their central banks to borrow money on terms allowing them to pay back less than the nominal amount borrowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **time value of money** is correctly based on the idea than cash at different dates has different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture will focus on the mathematics used to express the value of money at different dates: simple interest, compound interest, discount factors, yield-to-maturity, yield curve, and present value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that the cash flows discussed are risk-free. Future lectures will focus on what happens when uncertainty (frequently called \"risk\") is added to the picture."

    "## Advice: Keep in mind time units\n",
    "\n",
    "When making calculations involving interest rates, it is important to keep in mind the units in which quantities are measured. An **interest rate** has time units (e.g., an annual interest rate of 4 percent per year). If you invest \\\\$100.00 at an interest rate of 4 percent per year for 6 months, the interest earned is 2 percent (a dimensionless quantitiy). The value of the interest is \\\\$2.00 (dollar units!). Thus, \"interest\" can have time units, no units, or dollar units, depending upon how it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**: When working with interest rates, explicitly include a time period. Thus, the total return associated with a simple interest rate of 4 percent for a time period of $\\Delta t = 6 \\text{ months}$ can be written $R = 1 + r \\sm \\Delta t = 1 + 0.04 \\sm 0.50 = 1.02$.  This says that investing \\\\$100.00 for 6 months at an simple interest rate of 4 percent per year multiplies the number of dollars by 1.02.  Note that $r$ has units of \"per year\" and $\\Delta t$ has units of \"years\", so $r \\Delta t$ is a dimensionless quantity.  Since the number 1 is also a dimensionless quantity, it makes sense to add the dimensionless quantities 1 and $r \\sm \\Delta t$.  The expression $1 + r$ does not make sense because $r$ has units of \"per year\" but 1 is dimensionless (and definitely does not mean one year!).\n",

    "Given that discount factors and the interest rates derived from them are equivalent ways of converying the same economic and financial information, why do we need both interest rates and discount factors?\n",

If interest rates are positive, it is a monotonically decreasing function of maturity date $t_1$, given $t_0$. The \"discount rate\", simple interest rate, or compound interest rate, by contrast, all have time units and may be increasing, decreasing, or constant as functions of maturity date $t_1$ given $t_0$.\n"

    "## Quoting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quoting** refers to the idea that interest rates (derived from discount factors) provide a convenient language for exprssing prices for assets which could also otherwise be expressed as discount factors. It is often inconvenient, non-intuitive, and error-prone to conduct trading by using discount factors or prices for dollars in the future. This was particularly the case historically, when trading was conducted by word of mouth by traders trying to keep track of market conditions in their heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inconvenient: If all interest rates rise by the same amount, say 25 basis points, it is much easier to add 25 basis points to previously quoted interest rates than to re-calculate all of the discount factors which might be relevant for different compounding intervals and maturities, especially if you are doing it your head for making trades over a telephone.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-intuitive: If the discount factors for 90-day instruments change, converting the change into what it implies for other maturities might not be obvious if doing it in your head.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Error-prone: Some errors are associated with misunderstandings about maturity. If discount rates for different maturities are similar, fixing errors involving rates should require making only small changes.  But if errors are made in quoting discount factors, this might imply huge dollar errors, even if the discount rates are the same.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When used for quoting, interest rates follow a **market convention** (generally understood language with precisely defined terms) about how to infer market prices from quoted rates.  In markets, the quoting conventions have historically been a mixture of simple interest, compounded interest, and discount factors, with continuously compounded rates less frequently. \n",

    "Here is an example expressing the yield curve as a function with a typical shape, in which the interest rate for short maturities is less than the interest rate for long maturities, the term structure is quite **flat** (nearly constant) for the longer maturities, and the yield curve is **monotonically upward sloping**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is defined in terms of three parameters: a long rate `rlong`, a short rate `rshort`, and a mean reversion parameter `alpha`.  The three parameters are simplistically **packed** into a numpy array of length three to make the function convenient for later use. For example, we might later estimate the function's parameters using an algorithm from a Python package such as *scipy*. The algorithm may know about *numpy* arrays and expect numpy arrays as arguments to a function instead of a tuple of parameters. Of course, the algorithm may not know about long rates or short rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-world model, the three parameters would be **estimated** from data on market interest rates. Here the three parameters are chosen a priori for purposes of illustrating yield curve shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practitioners often use intuitive interpretations of parameters to describe the shape of the yield cure.  For example, **level**, **slope**, and **curvature** are terms often use the describe the shape of the yield curve. Parameters describing level, slope, and curvature are oftern used to describe quadratic function. \n",

    "A strategy of making a series fo short-term investments in long-maturity bonds is likely the most profitable of all. As time passes, the maturity of a previously-bought fixed-income security shortens. If you buy a security with a maturity of ten years and hold it for a year, it will be a nine-year security at the end of the one-year holding period; its **maturity date** has not changed but its actual **maturity** has shortened. **Rolling over** refers to the idea of replacing the previous investment with a different one.  In this case, one might buy ten-you Treasury notes soon after issuance, hold them for a year---at which point in time they will be nine-year notes---then sell the nine-year notes and buy newly issued ten-year notes again. Regardless of how frequently the investments are rolled over, practitioners call this strategy **riding the yield curve**. The yield curve may not change, but returns on investing in different maturities are different.\n",

SVB invested in long-maturity U.S. Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities.  It financed these investments with short-term deposits. When interest rates rose, the value of the long maturity securities fell and the cost of financing them rose. This would have wiped out the bank's capital if the capital were calculated based on market values of the long-dated securities."

    "\n",
    "1. Investors might prefer the predictability of rolling over short-term investments to holding longer term investments which might have to be sold at a loss before maturity.  This consideration leads to the hypothesis that short-term investments generally have lower expected returns than long-term investments.\n",

    "2. Shorter term bonds are more **liquid** than longer term bonds in the sense that the costs of buying and selling them are lower. Therefore an investor contemplating potentially needing to sell an investment to raise cash might prefer more liquid, shorter term securities.  This is applicable to **asset managers**, **corporations**, and **central banks** (which hold foreign currencies as **reserves**.)\n",

The so-called **preferred habitat theory** says that specific investors---for institutional, regulatory, risk managment, or public policy motives---might prefer investments with specific maturities.  For example, **life insurance** companies funding **annuities** (fixed periodic payments) for retirees who want fixed monthly incomes might prefer to invest in bonds with whose interest and principal payments correspond to the expected payments to retirees.  This might push long rates to levels making expected returns on short rates higher than long rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Central banks** have in the past decade pursued policies of **quantitative easing** (**QE**), which involve massive purchases of bonds with relatively long maturities.  This drives the price of the bonds up and the returns on the bonds down, perhaps so far down that rolling over short-term bonds offers higher returns than holding long-term bonds.

    "The forward rates have three arguments related to time, $t_0$, $t_1$, and $m_2$. I have chosen to make the first two terms **dates** and the third term a **maturity**. Researchers and practitioners use different but equivalent ways to express the same idea.  For example, we could use three dates and write $r_f(t_0, t_1, t_2)$ or use one date and two maturities $r_f(t_0, m_1, m_2)$. These are all equivalent conceptually because the dates can be derived from the maturities and vice versa using $m_1 = t_1 - t_0$ and $m_2 = t_2 - t_1$. It is important to use consistent notation!"

    "# Uses of Term-Structure Models\n",
    "\n",
    "What are term structure models used for?  Practitioners use them for many purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a security is not actively traded, the term structure model can give a **estimate** (or **prediction**) for what the security is worth at the date $t_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These predictions have multiple usese:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model values can be used for **trading**.  Asset managers can use them to determine whether a **market maker** is offering a reasonable price.  Market makers can use them to offer reasonable prices to customers.  They can be used to measure **trading costs** (difference between actual price paid and a more accurate, more favorable price better reflecting the asset's value). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The model values can be used to **mark to market** assets in a portfolio, especially thinly traded ones. For example, a bank may use a term structure model to calculate **asset valuations** and **liability valuations** for the purpose of determining capital requirements.  This requires assigning prices to assets which may not have traded for a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: If assets have and **active market** (the opposite of **thinly traded**), then the active market price is probably more useful than a model price.  Most good models will fit active market prices very accurately because the model will put a **high weight** on the the active assets in the **model estimation algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When model-implied prices differ from market prices, there are two possible interpretations: (A) The model is incorrect and perhaps needs improving. (B) The market is mispricing the asset, and a potentially good trading opportunity is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model is too parsimonious, it may generate a model-implied yield curve which is too smooth and gives misleading prices for trading purposes.  If the model has too many parameters, it may fit every asset's price almost perfectly and say that there are potentially no good trading opportunities, even when good trading opportunities are present."

    "\n",
    "So far we have discussed **zero-coupon bonds**, defined as fixed-income securities with one cash flow payoff at maturity $m$ but not other cash flows.\n",

    "A term structure model can be used to value fixed-income securities with multiple payoffs at different points in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a fixed-income security has cash flows $\\mathbf{c} = (-p_0^{mkt}, c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_K)$ at dates $\\mathbf{t} = (t_0, t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_K)$. The initial component $-p_0^{mkt}$ is the market price of a the security at date $t_0$. The price $-p_0^{mkt}$ has a minus sign because the price is a negative cash flow to the buyer at date $t_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $c$ and $t$ can be thought of mathematically as vectors. In Python, they could be tuples (suggested by the notation), lists, or numpy arrays. \n",

    "The initial date at which the security is priced is $t_0$. For each date $t_k$, $k=1,2,\\ldots$, we can define a time interval until payment $m_k = t_k - t_0$, then use the yield curve function to obtain the **model-implied interest rate** $r(\\pi, m_k) = f_{yc}^{model}(\\pi, m_k)$, where $\\pi$ represents the parameters of the model (called `parms` in the definition of `fyc` above). From the model-implied interest rate $r(\\pi, m_k)$, we calculate a **model-implied discount factor** $df^{model}(\\pi, m_k) = \\exp(-r^{model}(\\pi, m_k) \\sm m_k)$. Since the discount factor is the present value of one dollar, the present value of the $k$th cash flow $c_k$ is $df^{model}(\\pi, m_k) \\sm c_k$. \n",

In mathematical jargon, the present value function $PV^{model}$ is a **linear operator** which operates on cash flow vectors $\\mathbf{c}$.  For this course, all you have to remember about linear operators is that they can often be implemented using an inner product of two vectors (or as a matrix-vector product for calculated many prices simultaneously).\n",

In this way I generate some up-front cash now because I have sold assets with greater value than the asset bought. In the future, my future cash flows are the same as they would be otherwise because the future cash flows on the asset bought exactly replace the future cash flows on the asset sold.  \n",

    "An extreme case of a good trading opportunity is an **arbitrage opportunity**. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two definitions of arbitrage opportunities: the theoretical definition which finance researchers use and the practical definition that traders use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finance researchers define an **arbitrage opportunity** as a configuration of asset prices such that buying a specific portfolio of assets and selling another specific portfolio of assets of equal total market value (so that cash receipts from the assets sold are exactly the amount needed to pay for the assets bought), generates positive cash flows at some date but generates negative cash flows at no dates.  The idea of an arbitrage opportunity is getting **something for nothing** (positive cash at some date---future or present---with no negative cash flow at any date). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful mathematical theorems come into play here:\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that defining discount factors with the exp() function guarantees that the discount factors are positive because the exp function always evaluates to a positive number (for inputs which are **real**---not **complex**---numbers).  It does not, however, guarantee that the discount factors $df(m)$ are downward-sloping in $m$. The discount factors are downward sloping is all implied forward rates are non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent yield curves for U.S. dollars, Euros, Japanese yen, and Swiss francs hae sometimes had negative rates. I think it is reasonable to tighten the definition of arbitrage opporunity by allowing annualized rates to be slightly negative, say no more negative than $-1.00$ percent. This will reduce the number of trading opportunities which satisfy the definiton of an arbitrage opportunity. Adding slightly negative interest rates as a possibility is based on the idea that **storing money under a mattress** or **hoarding cash** is a possible investment opportunity, but storing cash has costs related to inconnvenience and keeping the cash secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If there are no arbitrage opportunities available in the market for **risk-free** fixed income securities, then there exists a term structure model, with positive discount factors which are downward-sloping in $m$ (an either have non-negative implied forward rates or forward rates greater than $-1.00$ percent per year), which fits all of the securities prices **perfectly** (i.e., with zero error). While this term structure model defines **arbitrage-free** prices, it might not be the model a trader would want to use because it would have so many parameters that some good trading opportunities (which are not arbitrage opportunities) might not be identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If there are arbitrage opportunities, then no model with positive discount factors will fit prices perfectly. Furthermore, the arbitrage opportunities will involve at least some assets which the model prices imperfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, a real-world trader would want to take advantage of a significant arbitrage opportunity identified by a model which a researcher would like.  In addition, a real world trader would also want to take advantage of trading opportunities which look attractive but do not satisfy the strict criteria for being an arbitrage opportunity. Opportunistic trader are looking for trades with an attractive risk-return trade-off.  To find these, traders use models that are **parsimonious** enough that they do not fit all prices perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world traders define **arbitrage** as **long-short trading** (buying some assets and selling or **selling short** others) which has small risk compared to the potential return.  This is different from the concept of **riskless arbitrage opportunities** that finance researchers, especially theorists, like.\n",
