    "## Yield to Maturity\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the era of computers, when securities were valued using pencil-and-paper calculations, it was too much trouble for traders to value bonds by constructing a yield curve with potentially different interest rates determining discount factors for pricing cash flows at different dates.  Instead, the more intuitive concept of **yield to maturity** was developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **yield to maturity** on a fixed income security is defined mathematically as the constant interest rate which makes the present value of the security equal to its current price. The yield to maturity is also called the **internal rate of return** on a fixed income security. From a static perspective, the constant interest rate can be interpreted as a **flat** yield curve which uses the same interest rate to calculate different discount factors for cash flows at every future date. From a dynamic perspective, the constant interest rate can also be interpreted as the hypothetical assumption that future short-term interest rates are known to be the same as the yield to maturity; they do not change over time. This implies that when cash flows on the security are received, they can be reinvested at the same rate (yield to maturity). Together, these assumptions imply that current interest rates are the same for all maturities, and future interest rate are known to be the same as the current rate for all maturities as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Defined this way, the yield to maturity is associated with two functions: (1) a function mapping to yield to maturity to the price of the security, and (2) an inverse function mapping the price of a security to its yield.\n",

    "### Present Value and Net Present Value as a functions of yield to maturity\n",
    "\n",
    "The function mapping the yield to the hypothetical price present value is straightforward. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a sequence (vector) of known cash flows denoted $\\vec{c} = (c[0], c[1], \\ldots, c[K])$ at dates $\\vec{t} = (\\vec{t}=t[0], t[1], \\ldots, t[K])$. Here, the date $t[0]$ is typically assumed to the the current date and the dates $t[1]$, $\\ldots$, $t[K]$ are assumed to be monotonically increasing and greater than $t[0]$, so they represent dates in the future. The initial cash payment $c[0]$ is typically negative and represents the price paid for a security. The future cash flows $c[1]$, $\\ldots$, $c[K]$ are typically assumed to be positive and represent the fixed (known, nonrandom) cash flows obtained from investing in a security. \n",
    "\n",
    "One complication is that these functions depend on the compounding convention used to quote the yield.  Typically, the compounding convention is chosen to match the timing of cash flows on a bond.  For example, with U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, the coupon interest is paid semi-annually, so a **bond-equivalent yield** $y_2$ with semi-annual compounding is used.  For mortgages, a monthly payment convention is used, so the yield might be written $y_{12}$ to denote monthly payments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a number of compounding periods $N$ per year (e.g. $N=2$ or $N=12$), an annual yield $y_N$, with current date $t_0$, the value of the cash flows can be represented in two slightly different ways, which we call **present value** and **net present value**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term **present value** is shorthand for \"present value of future cash flows\" and therefore ignores the first cash flow $c[0]$ which occurs at the current date, not the future. We can defined a present value function as corresponding to a given yield to maturity $y_N$ as\n",

    "In a typical application, an investor contemplating an investment opportunity uses a yield to maturity to calculate the security's present value, then compares this present value with the it market price $p_0$. The market price defines the initial negative cash flow $c[0] := -p_0$, which is used as an input into the NPV formula.  If the net present value is positive, this means that the present value of the future cash flows is greater than the cost $p_0 = -c[0]$. In this case, the investment opportunity has **positive net present value**, and the investor will want to purchase the security for a price $p_0 = -c[0]$. If the net present value is negative, the investor will want to avoid purchasing the security and may in fact want to sell it if the security is held in the investor's portfolio. He may even want to **sell the security short** by borrowing it from the portfolio of another investor; this requires a **security lending transaction**, which requires paying something to borrow the security, so the borrowing cost must compared to the NPV to determine whether a short sale is worthwhile.\n",

    "Problem: Calculate the present values and net present values of a two-year note offered for sale at a price of 99.98 percent of par on its day of issuance. The two-year note has a 3.00 percent coupon. Use 11 different hypothetical bond-equivalent-yields to maturity $\\vec{y}_2[0] = 2.00$, $\\vec{y}_2[1] = 2.20$, $\\ldots$, $\\vec{y}_2[10] = 4.00$ percent:\n",

    "We will use the typical market convention that the **par value** (principal paid back at maturity) is 100, which means \"100 percent of the par value\" or \"per 100 dollars of face value\". The coupons are 3.00 percent of the par value per year, which corresponds to 1.50 percent of par value per half-year.  The yield to maturity is a fraction: 0.0200, 0.0220, $\\ldots$, 0.0400, so the semi-annual rate corresponding to a yield of 4.00 percent per year is $0.0400 / 2 = 0.0200 = 2$ percent per half-year.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Define assumptions with descriptive names. (Avoid hard-coding assumptions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use built-in numpy functions to perform calculations efficiently. (Avoid loops coded by hand. Avoid writing explicit loops in Python or numpy. NB: List comprehensions may use Python loops, so I have used `np.linspace` to create arrays; `np.linspace` is typically better than the very similar function `np.arange`, which could also be used.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use pandas for display and manipulation of data. (In this problem, there is little data manipulation, so all the computational work is done with numpy. But pandas is used to illustrate display of information.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make code easy to update or modify. For example, it is sometimes convenient to be able to change the `dtype` easily. I have explicitly defined the dtype as `np.float64`. This is useful if you may switch to a different dtype, such as `np.float32`, for computational efficiency. In our example, this line is not really necessary since numpy tends to create arrays of type `np.float64` by default. By defining the dtype once, the line \"`dtyp=np.float64`\" makes it easy to change the dtype for the entire example. For finance calculations, accuracy requirements often make it better to use `np.float64` instead of `np.float32`. Statistical estimation is sometimes computationally more efficient using `np.float32`.\n"

    "# Yield to maturity: hypothetical meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine what the yield-to-maturity concept means financially and economically, consider a hypothetical market in which market participants believe that short-term interest rates will be constant forever, and these beliefs are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hypothetical market, the market price of a fixed income security should be given by the the present value formula in the previous equation, with the yield to maturity equal to the known short rate. Why?  The short answer is that under the hypothetical assumptions we are making, fixed income securities are all **priced by arbitrage**. An **arbitrage opportunity** is a trading strategy which generates a positive cash flow with no initial investment (or, alternatively, generates positive cash flow today with no negative cash flows in the future). The phrase **priced by arbitrage** means that there is a price at which there is no arbitrage opportunity available for market participants. For all other prices, an arbitrage opportunity is available to market participants. This no-arbitrage price is the zero-NPV price. Why? At lower prices, investors would want to buy the security. At higher prices, investors would want to sell the security. At the no-arbitrage price, investors want to neither buy nor sell the security.\n",
    "\n",
    "The longer answer explains how the arbitrage works: If the security is priced in the market at a level above its present value, a market participant could sell the security, then invest the proceeds in a hypothetical **money-market-fund** (a fund which rolls over safe short-term securities and earns a return equal to the short-term interest rate). The investor can use the cash in the money-market fund to replicate the cash flows on the overvalued security by withdrawing from the fund an amount equal to each cash flow on each date a cash flow is paid. To replicate a cash flow of $c[k]$ on date $t[k]$, the investor needs to have deposited $\\frac{c[k]}{(1 + \\tfrac{y_N}{N})^{N \\sm (t[k] - t[0])}}$ into the money market fund at date $t_0$ because this will allow the amount deposited to grow to exactly $c[k]$ over the period $t[k] - t[0]$, *assuming that the future short rate, which defines the reinvestment rate earned by the fund, is constant and equal to the yield to maturity on the fixed income security*.  Since the amount needed to replicate all of the cash flows is precisely the present value of the bond, the investor who sells the bond for more than its present value makes an arbitrage profit equal to the difference between the higher market value and the lower present value. If the investor only deposits the present value into the fund, while keeping the difference and spending it on personal consumption, he still has enough cash in the fund to replicate all of the cash flows on the security.\n",
    "\n",
    "This arbitrage strategy also works in reverse.  If the market price is less than the present value, the investor can buy the asset and pay for it by withdrawing cash from a money market fund, then deposit all of the cash flows from the asset bought back into the fund as they are earned.  Eventually, the asset bought will mature, at which point the investor will have more cash in his money-market fund than he would have had otherwise, *assuming that the future short rate, which defines the reinvestment rate earned by the fund, is constant and equal to the yield to maturity on the fixed income security*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no arbitrage opportunities in this hypothetical market, *all securities should have exactly the same yield to maturity*, and this yield to maturity makes the NPV equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "A related arbitrage strategy makes it easy to show that if the yield to maturity on a coupon bond is equal to its coupon (divided by its par value of 100), then the present value of the bond is equal to its par value.  Suppose the bond has coupon rate $c$ and one coupon payment left. If it is priced at par, then I can buy it for 100, and I obtain $100 + c / N$ at maturity. If the yield to maturity is $y = c / 100.00$, then investing 100.00 in a money market fund paying rate $y$ gives me the same amount, $100 \\sm (1.00 + y / N) = 100.00 + c / N$. I buy the bond at par two periods before maturity and sell it one period before maturity, then the same argument goes through because I have already shown that the price with one period to maturity is equal to the bond's par value.  Now I can go back one period at a time to show that the same result holds for every period:  Buying the bond at par, holding it for one period, then selling it at par gives converts the par value of 100 into $100 + c / N)$; putting 100 into a money market fund and holding for one period pays off $100 + 100 \\sm y / N$.  These two quantities are the same if $y = c / 100$.\n"

In the yield-curve model, the rates used to discount cash flows at different dates are different because $f_{yc}^{model}(\\pi, m[k])$ is a function of $m[k] = t[k] - t[0]$, but all of the rates in the various terms of the yield-to-maturity are the same value $y_N$.  This is a fundamental difference betwen a valuation based on a yield-curve model (with nonconstant term structure of interest rates) and a valuation based on yield to maturity (which \"implies\" a flat term structure of interest rates).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these differences, what is a useful intuitive financial interpretation of yield to maturity? I like to think of yield to maturity as a nonlinear way of \"averaging together\" the different interest rates on the yield curve to obtain one \"summary interest rate\" which gives the same valuation as would be obtained by discounting cash flows at different dates using different rates from the \"correct\" yield curve model. Of course, this averaging works differently for different securities; different securities will have different yields to maturity, even if their values correspond with those from a \"correct\" non-flat yield curve.  For example, if the yield cureve is upward sloping, then longer maturity securities will tend to have higher yields to maturity than shorter maturity securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we use yield to maturity to spot mispriced securities? Having corrected for quotation conventions, we must realize that yield differences result both from different temporal patterns of cash flows and from mispricing. To identify mispricing, we need to adjust for the differences in yield which might be implied by different maturities.  It may be difficult to do these calculations in one's head, but this is indeed how such calculations were frequently done in the past!\n",

For example, the British government issued perpetuities called **consols**; these were bonds which payed fixed coupons forever and had no mandatory maturity date. Nowadays, perpetuities are mostly used in hypothetical examples to derive annuity formulas (like we are about to do).\n",

Now let us assume that this result extends to bonds with infinite maturity; this will be the case if the present value of payments beyond period $t$ goes to zero as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$ because the value of a bond with very, very long maturity will converge to the value of a bond with infinite maturity due to the very distant cash flows having a vanishing present value. Then a bond with coupon equal to $100.00 \\sm y$ will have a present value of $100.00$. If we multiply the coupon by a factor of $c / 100.00$, the present value will be multiplied by the same factor. We obtain the result that the present value of an annuity with coupon $c$ is $c / y$. This result depends on the quoted yield having a compounding convention corresponding to the number of coupon payments per year. For example, if the coupon is paid twice per year, then the value is $c / y_2$, where $y_2$ is the bond-equivalent yield corresponding to compounding twice per year.

My experience is that if a problem might theoretically occur, then it will probably happen sooner than you think.  If it does, it may be difficult to debug. Therefore, it is best to recognize the problem early and deal with it before it occurs.\n",

The division of payments between principal and interest can be calculated in more than one way: (A) Calculate the present value of the remaining payments each month, then see how this present value falls over time. (B) Start with 400,000 owed, calculate the interest owed for the first month, then credit the rest of the first month's payment to principal, which reduces the principal.  Now repeat this over and over each month based on the reduced principal each month. \n"

    "While solving for asset prices (present value) as a function of yield to maturity is a straightforward closed-form calculation---either using an inner product with discount factors or an annuity formla---solving for yield to maturity as a function of asset price involves calculating an inverse function for which there is generally no closed-form solution.\n",

    "Computationally, the difficulty of calculating the inverse value is simplified when all the future cash flows on the asset are positive because this makes the present value a monotonically decreasing function of the yield to maturity.

    "\n",
    "2. The solver finds a value of `ytm` which makes the function `fnpvy` equal to zero.  Therefore the function `fnpvy` is defined so that the NPV is zero when the correct value of `ytm` is used. When the solver finds the value of `ytm` which makes the net present value `fnpv(ytm, c, m, nfreq)` equal to zero, it is finding the value of `ytm` which gives the future cash flows a present value equal to the initial price `-cf[0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The example illustrates two solvers. The function `scipy.optimize.root_scalar` will pick an algorithm automatically, depending on which arguments are provided. The function `scipy.optimize.brentq` requires an initial pair of guesses which bracket the solution. If the pair of initial guesses do not bracket the solution (i.e., give one positive and one negative value since the desired solution is zero), an exception occurs. (You can verify this by changing the bracketing interval to make it very small.)\n",

    "## Notes on root finding algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many algorithms for finding the roots of scalar functions.  Of course, the function needs to be monotonic to guarantee that there is at most one root.  If so, then an initial guess which **brackets** the root is guaranteed to work (theoretically), assuming that the function is continuous. Given that a solution makes the value of the function zero, a pair of guesses brackets the root if one guess makes the function positive and the other makes it negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms work by improving guesses iteratively, eventually converging to a solution, typically by improving a **bracketing interval**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quick summary of how different scalar root-finding algorithms work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **bisection method** starts with two guesses which bracket the solution, then selects the next guess as the midpoint, obtains a smaller bracketing interval, and continues until the two guesses which bracket the solution are equal up to a given tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **secant method** pretends that the function is the linear function defined by its values at the endpoints of the bracketing interval, solves the linear function for the value which makes it zero, then obtains a better bracketing interval.\n",

Given a price for a security, first calculate the yield to maturity corresponding to that price.  Then calulate the duration from this yield.  This logic emphasizes that the duration changes with the security's price. If the price of a security falls, its yield rises.  This decreases the discount factor used to value each cash flow, but the discount factor for more distant cash flows falls percentage-wise by more than the discount factor for more nearby cash flows.  *The yield duration of the security becomes less when its price falls* because the more distant cash flows are a smaller percentage of its present value.

    "1. The definition of price sensitivity duration is based on a continuously compounded yield. When calculating yield duration, the same duration number is obtained regardless of the compounding convention used because the present value of each cash flow will be unaffected by the compounding convention used.  When calculating price sensitivity duration, the compounding convention does matter because the derivative of one yield compounding convention with respect to another is not exactly one. The adjustment due to the derivative of one yield compounding convention with respect to another adds clutter to the definition of price sensitivity duration and adds confusion  to the discussion of these concepts.  The clutter is minimized when continuous compounding is the compounding convention.  This is yet another mathematical advantage of working with continuously compounded interest rates.\n",

    "2. While yield duration is based on the hypothetical assumption that interest rates are constant and never change, the concept of price sensitivity duration can be implemented when the cash flows do change as a function of the yield. For example, cash flows on mortgages are not exactly fixed because the homeowner might **default** on the mortgage or **prepay** it. If defaults and prepayments change with yield in a predictable way, it is possible to apply the price sensitivity duration concept to a fixed income security whose cash flows are not precisely fixed but are instead assumed to be functions of the yield to maturity. This way of thinking can easily become unwieldly or internally inconsistent. Aa related approach is to use the empirically observed relationship between change in price and change in yields on say Treasury securities to define an **empirical duration** concept applicable to \"fixed income\" securities whose cash flows are not exactly fixed. This approach is a variation on yield sensitivity duration.\n",
